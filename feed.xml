It contains this <strong>dangerous chemical called lactic acid</strong>.</p> <p>Have a look at the <a href="https://www.fishersci.com/store/msds?partNumber=A159500&amp;productDescription=LACTIC+ACID+USP%2FFCC+500ML&amp;vendorId=VN00033897&amp;countryCode=US&amp;language=en">Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)</a> for lactic acid:</p> <ul> <li><strong>not for food</strong></li> <li>causes <strong>skin irritation</strong></li> <li>causes serious <strong>eye damage</strong></li> </ul> <p>Have a look at the first aid measures:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Wash off from skin immediately</strong>. Obtain medical attention</li> <li><strong>Clean mouth with water</strong> and drink afterwards plenty of water</li> <li>Move to fresh air. If breathing is difficult, <strong>give oxygen</strong>. Obtain medical attention</li> </ul> <p>Why are you even eating something so dangerous? Don’t you know that eating cheese could actually threaten your life?</p> <p>Still don’t believe me? Well, this is all coming from a reputable chemical company, Thermo Fischer Scientific, who produces instruments to analyze dangerous chemicals like lactic acid. Click this <a href="https://www.fishersci.com/store/msds?partNumber=A159500&amp;productDescription=LACTIC+ACID+USP%2FFCC+500ML&amp;vendorId=VN00033897&amp;countryCode=US&amp;language=en">link</a> to view their findings.</p> <p>Trust me, I have a bachelors in Chemistry. I know what I am talking about. <strong>Cheese contains lactic acid which is dangerous to you.</strong> It is, after all, an acid.</p> <p>Should you continue to still eat cheese? You may wish to carefully re-think whether eating cheese is actually good for you.</p> <p>Okay, on a scale of 1 (absolute nonesense!) - 10 (please ban cheese!), how convincing was this to you? Write it down on a piece of paper before you proceed.</p> <h2 id="how-to-determine-if-a-substance-is-harmful">How to Determine if A Substance is Harmful</h2> <p>To some of you the arguments above may sound pretty convincing and you know that something is off. You just don’t know which part is off. With chemical-related news, there is a way to debunk this argument using these 3 below:</p> <h4 id="1-concentration">1. Concentration</h4> <p>With the right concentration, any substance can be toxic. Even water can be toxic. Have you ever heard of water intoxication? You can read <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ecstasy-girl-may-have-drunk-too-much-water-1583245.html">this article on Leah Betts</a>, where she drank 7L of water in one shot and passed away as a result. <strong>Any substance can be toxic with the right amount</strong>. How do you determine the right amount? This is where the next point comes in.</p> <h4 id="2-toxicity">2. Toxicity</h4> <p>How do you measure the toxicity of a substance? Typically, the <strong>LD50</strong> of a substance is used as a benchmark. This is measured by determining what dose of a substance needs to be given to kill 50% of the population of lab rats. While rats are different from humans, this is one of the better tools scientists use to measure toxicity. You can find out more about LD50 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877490/">here</a>.</p> <h4 id="3-evidence">3. Evidence</h4> <p>How many people have died from consuming the substance so far? If there are none or close to few, the substance is likely safe for consumption. Many products, especially pharmaceutical products, have to undergo multiple rigorous medical trials before being released to the public. If you truly want to understand if something is toxic, you can refer to the papers on the medical trials that were conducted and draw your conclusions from those instead.</p> <p>Equipped with the above knowledge, this is what it will look like to debunk the argument for banning lactic acid above:</p> <h4 id="1-concentration-1">1. Concentration</h4> <p>Typically, cheese contains <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7787130_Enhanced_Lactose_Cheese_Milk_does_not_Guarantee_Calcium_Lactate_Crystals_in_Finished_Cheddar_Cheese">about 1.5-2.0% lactic acid</a>.</p> <h4 id="2-toxicity-1">2. Toxicity</h4> <p>Using the MSDS from Thermo Fischer Scientific, you can find the toxicological information of cheese under section 11 where the LD50 (Oral) is 3,543 mg/kg. Assuming an average human weights 60 kg, you would need to consume 213g of lactic acid to have 50% chance of dying. Let’s be generous and assume that the concentration of lactic acid is at 1.5%, the lower end. We would need to consume 14.2kg of cheese in one go to have a 50% chance of dying from cheese overdose. Now, that’s a lot of cheese!</p> <h4 id="3-evidence-1">3. Evidence</h4> <p>Humans have been eating cheese <a href="https://fermentology.pubpub.org/pub/boc0yude/release/1">since 9,000 years ago</a>. If they can indeed cause death, a lot of people would have died from eating cheese already. It just does not make sense unless you are consuming spoiled cheese (which has an entirely different toxic substance altogether)</p> <p>Not so scary anymore right?</p> <p>You would be surprise how many news articles out there use fear to scare people and push them to achieve their own agenda. Learn to discern when your fear is being triggered and understand what is triggering that fear. Only then will you have a more accurate picture of what the truth really is.</p> <p>Go and uncover the hidden truth beneath the surface - Vicente III</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="science"/><category term="chemistry"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The truth may not what it seems to be]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Toxic Truth</title><link href="https://vicente-iii.github.io/blog/2023/toxic-truth/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Toxic Truth"/><published>2023-11-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-11-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://vicente-iii.github.io/blog/2023/toxic-truth</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://vicente-iii.github.io/blog/2023/toxic-truth/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="dihydrogen-monoxide">Dihydrogen Monoxide</h2> <p>Have you ever heard of dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO)? Based on a quick Google search, this is the information you can find:</p> <blockquote> Dihydrogen monoxide: <ul> <li>is also known as hydroxyl acid, and is the major component of acid rain.</li> <li>contributes to the "greenhouse effect."</li> <li>may cause severe burns.</li> <li>contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape.</li> <li>accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals.</li> <li>may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes.</li> <li>has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.</li> </ul> - Coalition to Ban DHMO </blockquote> <p>Do you think we should ban the use of DHMO? Write down your answer on a piece of paper. If you are still undecided, you can read more <a href="https://www.dhmo.org/facts.html">here</a> to decide on an answer.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="what-is-dhmo-actually">What is DHMO actually?</h2> <p>Before I reveal what DHMO actually, make sure you have an answer. Whether we should ban DHMO or not. Write it on a piece of paper before you scroll any further.</p> <p>So what is DHMO actually? It is <b><em>water</em></b>! The name Dihydrogen monoxide is the chemical name for H<sub>2</sub>O.</p> <p>Now look at your answer on your piece of paper. How do you feel about it? If you answered ‘No’, good for you! You are able to detect the lies that are hidden beneath the truth.</p> <p>If you answered ‘Yes’, it shows that there is still room for improvement. Surprisingly, when this question was recently asked to higher education students in Portugal, majority of the students voted to ban the substance. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343420533_GENDER_PERCEPTION_ABOUT_FAKE_NEWS_AND_DISINFORMATION_CASE_STUDY_WITH_PORTUGUESE_HIGHER_EDUCATION_STUDENTS">Check the source here</a>. It would not be surprising if we would get a similar results when this poll is done to the general public. Even more scary is the thought of having this debate in a legislative setting and majority of the legislators decide to ban DHMO.</p> <p>Words that are unfamiliar often intimidate us. People can get away with telling half-truths to mask the lies that hide beneath it. The facts above about DHMO are all true. None of them are lies. The facts are just hidden beneath the message. It is frightening how easily this can be achieved to push people to make decisions to fit other people’s agenda. It is important for us to go beyond the truth to figure out the lies that are hidden beneath the surface.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="how-to-uncover-hidden-lies">How to Uncover Hidden Lies</h2> <h4 id="1-increasing-your-knowledge">1. Increasing your knowledge</h4> <p>If you answered ‘Yes’ above, the reason you answered ‘Yes’ is because you do not know what DHMO is and you rely on other people to provide the answers to you. This clearly shows that whatever you do not know will be used against you. If you keep relying on other people to provide you with a better understanding of the world, you let others control what you understand and what you see. Do not let the unfamiliar intimidate you and always seek to understand the truth even when it may seem daunting.</p> <h4 id="2-check-the-source">2. Check the source</h4> <p>Find out who the author is. Knowing the author’s background and history provides more context on why they frame things in a certain way. Do they have the relevant expertise to share and provide a reliable opinion on the topic at hand? In the DHMO example, the quote was taken from the Coalition to Ban DHMO. A quick Google search online would easily tell you that no such organization actually exists. Also, if you continue browsing through the links, you will notice that DHMO is actually water.</p> <h4 id="3-figure-out-the-motive">3. Figure out the motive</h4> <p>Everyone has a reason for doing anything. In order to truly understand why the information is being shared the way it is, the true underlying motive needs to be understood properly. Only then will we know what the author is trying to make you do. Ironically, in the DHMO example, the author’s motive is to show how a harmless substance can be transformed into something vile just by cherry-picking the facts. Unfortunately, it has revealed another more pressing issue which must definitely be addressed.</p> <p>Of course, not all lies can be as easy to spot as DHMO, and the information provided to you will be incomplete most of the time. In my next post, I will share some tips on how to evaluate these types of news more critically.</p> <p>Stay focused and stay alive - Vicente III</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="science"/><category term="chemistry"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, the truth may contain hidden lies]]></summary></entry></feed>
