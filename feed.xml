Based on a quick Google search, this is the information you can find:</p> <blockquote> Dihydrogen monoxide: <ul> <li>is also known as hydroxyl acid, and is the major component of acid rain.</li> <li>contributes to the "greenhouse effect."</li> <li>may cause severe burns.</li> <li>contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape.</li> <li>accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals.</li> <li>may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes.</li> <li>has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.</li> </ul> - Coalition to Ban DHMO </blockquote> <p>Do you think we should ban the use of DHMO? Write down your answer on a piece of paper. If you are still undecided, you can read more <a href="https://www.dhmo.org/facts.html">here</a> to decide on an answer.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="what-is-dhmo-actually">What is DHMO actually?</h2> <p>Before I reveal what DHMO actually, make sure you have an answer to whether we should ban DHMO or not and write it on a pice of paper before you scroll any further.</p> <p>So what is DHMO actually? It is <b><em>water</em></b>! The name Dihydrogen monoxide is the chemical name for H<sub>2</sub>O.</p> <p>Now look at your answer on your piece of paper. How do you feel about it? If you answered ‘No’, good for you! You are able to detect the lies that are hidden beneath the truth.</p> <p>If you answered ‘Yes’, it shows that there is still room for improvement. Surprisingly, when this question was recently asked to higher education students in Portugal, majority of the students voted to ban the substance. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343420533_GENDER_PERCEPTION_ABOUT_FAKE_NEWS_AND_DISINFORMATION_CASE_STUDY_WITH_PORTUGUESE_HIGHER_EDUCATION_STUDENTS">Check the source here</a>. It would not be surprising if we would get a similar results when this poll is done to the general public. Even more scary is the thought of having this debate in a legislative setting and majority of the legislators decide to ban DHMO.</p> <p>Words that are unfamiliar often intimidate people. People can get away with telling truths to mask the lies that hide beneath it. It is frightening how easily this can be achieved to push people to make unfavourable decisions. It is important for us to go beyond the truth to figure out the lies that are hidden beneath the surface.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="how-to-uncover-hidden-lies">How to Uncover Hidden Lies</h2> <h4 id="1-increasing-your-knowledge">1. Increasing your knowledge</h4> <p>If you answered ‘Yes’ above, the reason you answered ‘Yes’ is because you do not know what DHMO is and you rely on other people to provide the answers to you. This clearly shows that whatever you do not know will be used against you. If you keep relying on other people to provide you with a better understanding of the world, you let others control what you understand and what you see. Do not let the unfamiliar intimidate you and always seek to understand the truth.</p> <h4 id="2-check-the-source">2. Check the source</h4> <p>Find out who the author is. Knowing the author’s background and history provides more context on why they frame things in a certain way. Do they have the relevant expertise to share and provide a reliable opinion on the topic at hand?</p> <h4 id="3-figure-out-the-motive">3. Figure out the motive</h4> <p>Everyone has a reason for doing anything. In order to truly understand why the information is being shared the way it is, the true underlying motive needs to be understood properly. Only then will we know what the author is trying to make you do. This also applies to anything I say on my blog as well.</p> <p>Stay focused and stay alive - Vicente III</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="science"/><category term="chemistry"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, the truth may contain hidden lies]]></summary></entry></feed>
