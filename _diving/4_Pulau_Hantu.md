Dive Date: 21 Mar 2020

For this trip, I decided to purchase a Sony Action Cam FDR-X3000

Diving in Singapore is quite interesting. There is nothing much to see and visibility is basically non-existent. I can only see within arms-length and it was extremely difficult to stick with the group!

### Dive #1 - North Jetty


### Dive #2 - North Jetty
