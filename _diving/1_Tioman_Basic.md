During my final year in university, I decided I want to try something new: scuba diving. At that time, none of my friends were interested in scuba diving, so I decided to take a stab at it alone, all by myself. I have not regret that decision ever since.

Diving is fun when you know how to remain safe. It is probably the most relaxing sport out there because if you want to stay underwater longer, you would need to stay calm and relaxed to not consume too much oxygen.

There are a few things to take note while diving:
- Oxygen level
- Buoyancy
- Depth
-
