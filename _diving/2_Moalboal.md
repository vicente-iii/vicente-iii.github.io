Dive Date: 21 Dec 2018

My friend from Thailand wanted to visit the Philippines and he knew how to dive. So we decided to head to Cebu for a short trip and do some diving as well. This time, we have a GoPro with us so you can enjoy the photos we took underwater.

For this dive trip, we dived with other tourists who were also visiting Cebu. I was the only one with a Basic Open Water license (meaning the deepest I can go is 20m), while everyone else has an Advance Open Water license (meaning the deepest they can go is 30m). So the deepest we could go was 20m and our dive master has to account for that. We even have a rescue diver in the group.

### Dive #1 - Umbrella
The main highlight for this dive is the plane wreck which can be found around 20m deep. The plane was placed there as part of an artificial coral reef project to regenerate the coral reef in the area. Sadly, the corals in the area is quite damaged and you can see the broken pieces of corals lying around on the sea floor.

During the dive, the rescue diver kept an eye on me to make sure I was doing okay. This was my deepest dive till date so I appreciate his kind gesture. The first dive of the day is a refresher for divers who haven't dived in a long time so we spent the rest of the dive chilling around the reef. Sadly, we didn't see any interesting animals except a few starfish and fishes swimming around reef.

### Dive #2 - Tongo Point
This dive was more interesting. We did a wall dive which I found out is quite advanced.


Wall dive - trial by fire

### Snorkeling
Other cool things to see at Moalboal after the dive:
- Sardine "storm"

### Bonus: Whale Shark - Oslob
