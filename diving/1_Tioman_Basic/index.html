At that time, none of my friends were interested in scuba diving, so I decided to take a stab at it alone, all by myself. I have not regret that decision ever since.</p> <p>Diving is fun when you know how to remain safe. It is probably the most relaxing sport out there because if you want to stay underwater longer, you would need to stay calm and relaxed to not consume too much oxygen. You just need to be equipped with the right knowledge to be able to react properly when things go wrong underwater. All of these will be covered when you do your Basic Open Water Certification either with PADI or SSI.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I do not have pictures so I will draw what I remembered seeing while I was underwater and upload them in the future.</p> <h3 id="dive-1---tomok">Dive #1 - Tomok</h3> <p>This is my first ever dive in the ocean. I still recalled that moment when I slowly released air from my buoyancy control device (BCD) and slowly sank beneath the ocean surface. The descent was initially intimidating, however, once I was able to confirm that I can properly breathe underwater, the fear dissipated. I feel liberated being able to breathe underwater. I spotted a lot of sea anemones and clownfish. None of the fishes want to approach us as our breathing was quite heavy and noisy underwater and it must have terrified them.</p> <p>The purpose of this dive is mainly to practice what we learned from our pool sessions:</p> <ul> <li>Clearing my mask when it gets foggy</li> <li>Finding my regulator when it is dislodged from my mouth</li> <li>Staying on same depth underwater (This is called buoyancy in scuba diving))</li> </ul> <p>While waiting for the instructor, I spotted a large sea urchin that was hiding behind a rock. Its spines were quite long and you would not want to be punctured by one of them. We had to swim above the sea urchin as part of our practice. While I was on top of the sea urchin, I looked down and saw that looks like eyes staring back at me. Later, I learned that those “eyes” are actually the sea urchin’s anus. Thankfully, it can’t jump and can’t see us so we won’t get stung unless we become careless.</p> <p>This dive was quite shallow at 5.7m. We would progressively go deeper in subsequent dives the more familiar we become.</p> <h3 id="dive-2---tomok">Dive #2 - Tomok</h3> <p>The aim for this dive was to practice our buoyancy and staying at the same depth. Buoyancy is one of the toughest skills to master in scuba diving and having a good mastery of it would allow you to consume less oxygen. We spent majority of the dive just practicing.</p> <p>Of course, we tried to look for interesting sea creatures, however, I did not spot anything interesting during the dive. However, my instructor was able to spot a moray eel which all of us were, unfortunately, not able to see.</p> <p>We went deeper this time at 8.7m.</p> <h3 id="dive-3---pirate-reef">Dive #3 - Pirate Reef</h3> <p>This dive was more of a fun dive and a chance for us to practice whatever skill we want to practice. It is also an excuse to go and look for any interesting sea creatures. There were two main highlights for this dive:</p> <ol> <li>The coral reef. It was the first time we see it and it was really beautiful</li> <li>We saw a small jellyfish at the end of the dive. Thankfully, no one got stung</li> </ol> <p>We went around 11m deep this time - finally breaking past the 10m mark!</p> <h3 id="dive-4---renggis-island">Dive #4 - Renggis Island</h3> <p>For this dive, we were required to learn how to use an underwater compass to navigate underwater. The goal was for us to swim a certain distance out and return to our original position. It sounds quite simple in principle, however, it is quite difficult in practice especially when you are underwater. You really would have to rely on the compass given to you as we did not have any landmark to rely on at all.</p> <p>We needed to learn this individually so the dive instructor had us waiting somewhere to practice whatever we want to practice. I spotted a few interesting creatures. I decided to look for tiny sea creatures instead and noticed a few small crabs scurrying along the sea floor. One of my dive buddies spotted a barracuda somewhere in the distance and I only managed to catch a glimpse of it before it swam away really fast.</p> <p>My dive buddies were luckier and saw a turtle which I was not able to spot.</p> <h3 id="dive-5---marine-park">Dive #5 - Marine Park</h3> <p>This dive site was one of the more interesting dive sites. There was barely any corals in the area and the sand on the seafloor is fairly loose. So if any of the divers have poor control of their buoyancy, a lot of sand will be kicked up and cause visibility to be really bad. Being with a group full of divers getting our basic certification, you can probably guess that any hope for good visibility was basically non-existent. The worst part, my group was the last one to go down, so by the time we reach the sea floor, our friends from the other group has already kicked up a lot of sand.</p> <p>The reason why this site is called Marine Park is because there are a lot of fishes in the area and we were allowed to bring bread to feed the fishes. After feeding the fishes, we swam around the area and spotted a pufferfish and a lionfish. I was not able to spot the lionfish camouflaged among the rocks and was only able to see it when one of my dive buddies showed me the video.</p> <p>What was most memorable about this dive was how I got disoriented underwater. We were swimming past this slope and had to make a quick stop to check if everyone in the group was present. Since the seafloor was slanted, I got confused as to which direction is up and which one is down and lost my sense of balance. It felt like I was tumbling around underwater. I only managed to regain my balance when I looked at my dive instructor and see how he positioned himself and followed suit. After the dive, I received a good tip on how to re-orient myself underwater: you just need to check where the bubbles are going as they only move upwards.</p> <h3 id="dive-6---soyak-island">Dive #6 - Soyak Island</h3> <p>Out of all the dives I had in this trip, this is by far the best one. We encountered a really strong current during the dive and we struggled to swim against the current. However, strong current usually indicates that we will see a lot of interesting sea creatures and that was what happened!</p> <p>We spotted a triggerfish. During September, they can be quite aggressive as this period is their mating season. They would attack you without hesitation to protect their eggs. Thankfully, we did not intrude their nesting ground and were able to avoid a direct confrontation with it.</p> <p>I spotted a turtle. Finally, we spotted a turtle after diving for so long, no less on our last dive of the entire trip. After the dive, my dive buddies told me that they spotted 4 turtles in total so I missed out 3 of them.</p> <p>I also spotted a stingray resting beneath a small cavern. We did not want to bother its rest so we took a quick look at it and went on our merry way.</p> <p>This was definitely the best dive of the trip and we are all able to go home feeling fulfilled with this.</p> <h3 id="overall">Overall</h3> <p>Overall, this trip was fun. It made me realize how vast the world is and how beautiful the ocean can truly be. I hope this will inspire you to take up diving and explore the ocean on your own and share your tales of adventure with everyone as well.</p> </article><div id="giscus_thread" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;"> <script>let giscusTheme=localStorage.getItem("theme"),giscusAttributes={src:"https://giscus.app/client.js","data-repo":"vicente-iii/vicente-iii.github.io","data-repo-id":"","data-category":"Comments","data-category-id":"","data-mapping":"title","data-strict":"1","data-reactions-enabled":"1","data-emit-metadata":"0","data-input-position":"bottom","data-theme":giscusTheme,"data-lang":"en",crossorigin:"anonymous",async:""},giscusScript=document.createElement("script");Object.entries(giscusAttributes).forEach(([t,e])=>giscusScript.setAttribute(t,e)),document.getElementById("giscus_thread").appendChild(giscusScript);</script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://giscus.app/?ref_noscript" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">comments powered by giscus.</a> </noscript> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Vicente Tiu Tangcueco III.
