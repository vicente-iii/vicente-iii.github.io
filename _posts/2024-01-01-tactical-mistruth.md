## Lactic Acid
Do you know what cheese contains? It contains this **dangerous chemical called lactic acid**.

Have a look at the [Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)](https://www.fishersci.com/store/msds?partNumber=A159500&productDescription=LACTIC+ACID+USP%2FFCC+500ML&vendorId=VN00033897&countryCode=US&language=en) for lactic acid:
- **not for food**
- causes **skin irritation**
- causes serious **eye damage**

Have a look at the first aid measures:
- **Wash off from skin immediately**. Obtain medical attention
- **Clean mouth with water** and drink afterwards plenty of water
- Move to fresh air. If breathing is difficult, **give oxygen**. Obtain medical attention

Why are you even eating something so dangerous? Don't you know that eating cheese could actually threaten your life?

Still don't believe me? Well, this is all coming from a reputable chemical company, Thermo Fischer Scientific, who produces instruments to analyze dangerous chemicals like lactic acid. Click this [link](https://www.fishersci.com/store/msds?partNumber=A159500&productDescription=LACTIC+ACID+USP%2FFCC+500ML&vendorId=VN00033897&countryCode=US&language=en) to view their findings.

Trust me, I have a bachelors in Chemistry. I know what I am talking about. **Cheese contains lactic acid which is dangerous to you.** It is, after all, an acid.

Should you continue to still eat cheese? You may wish to carefully re-think whether eating cheese is actually good for you.

Okay, on a scale of 1 (absolute nonesense!) - 10 (please ban cheese!), how convincing was this to you? Write it down on a piece of paper before you proceed.

## How to Determine if A Substance is Harmful
To some of you the arguments above may sound pretty convincing and you know that something is off. You just don't know which part is off. With chemical-related news, there is a way to debunk this argument using these 3 below:
#### 1. Concentration
With the right concentration, any substance can be toxic. Even water can be toxic. Have you ever heard of water intoxication? You can read [this article on Leah Betts](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ecstasy-girl-may-have-drunk-too-much-water-1583245.html), where she drank 7L of water in one shot and passed away as a result. **Any substance can be toxic with the right amount**. How do you determine the right amount? This is where the next point comes in.

#### 2. Toxicity
How do you measure the toxicity of a substance? Typically, the **LD50** of a substance is used as a benchmark. This is measured by determining what dose of a substance needs to be given to kill 50% of the population of lab rats. While rats are different from humans, this is one of the better tools scientists use to measure toxicity. You can find out more about LD50 [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877490/).

#### 3. Evidence
How many people have died from consuming the substance so far? If there are none or close to few, the substance is likely safe for consumption. Many products, especially pharmaceutical products, have to undergo multiple rigorous medical trials before being released to the public. If you truly want to understand if something is toxic, you can refer to the papers on the medical trials that were conducted and draw your conclusions from those instead.

Equipped with the above knowledge, this is what it will look like to debunk the argument for banning lactic acid above:
#### 1. Concentration
Typically, cheese contains [about 1.5-2.0% lactic acid](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7787130_Enhanced_Lactose_Cheese_Milk_does_not_Guarantee_Calcium_Lactate_Crystals_in_Finished_Cheddar_Cheese).

#### 2. Toxicity
Using the MSDS from Thermo Fischer Scientific, you can find the toxicological information of cheese under section 11 where the LD50 (Oral) is 3,543 mg/kg. Assuming an average human weights 60 kg, you would need to consume 213g of lactic acid to have 50% chance of dying. Let's be generous and assume that the concentration of lactic acid is at 1.5%, the lower end. We would need to **consume 14.2kg of cheese in one go to have a 50% chance of dying from cheese overdose**. Now, that's a lot of cheese! 

#### 3. Evidence
Humans have been eating cheese [since 9,000 years ago](https://fermentology.pubpub.org/pub/boc0yude/release/1). If they can indeed cause death, a lot of people would have died from eating cheese already. It just does not make sense unless you are consuming spoiled cheese (which has an entirely different toxic substance altogether)

Not so scary anymore right?

You would be surprise how many news articles out there use fear to scare people and push them to achieve their own agenda. Learn to discern when your fear is being triggered and understand what is triggering that fear. Only then will you have a more accurate picture of what the truth really is.
